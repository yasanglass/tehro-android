Tehro is a guide app for Tehran Metro powered by [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).

## Releases

You can get the official releases from either [GitHub](https://github.com/yasandev/tehro-android/releases), [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/dev.yasan.metro.fdroid/) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.yasan.metro).

**Note:** The F-Droid releases do **not** have internet access permission & any telemetry. The GitHub & Google Play Store releases do have Firebase telemetry.

## Database

The database used in the app is stored at [tehro-database](https://github.com/yasandev/tehro-database) repository as the database is a separate project from the Android client. You are more than welcome to create your own Tehro client for any platform.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. I recommend checking out the [open issues](https://github.com/yasandev/tehro-android/issues) and the [TODO comments](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-todo.html).
